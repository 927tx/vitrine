# Parity with spoti.pw 0.50.0

Every line of upstream's 0.22.0, 0.23.0-beta and 0.50.0 release notes, and where Vitrine stands on it.
Each feature is written from its release note and public APIs, never from upstream's code after
`c790445`, which is PolyForm Strict.

Numbers are the line's position in the three release notes, in order. Status:

- **done**: built and on main. "Device" means it still needs a check on a phone inside Spotify.
- **in progress**: being built on its own branch
- **todo**: to build
- **n/a**: depends on chroma.pw, Plus or the upstream server, so Vitrine leaves it out

A completeness audit on 2026-10-05 checked every done item below against its release note. Its gaps were
fixed in the commits that follow `956e65c`.

### Beta gaps (0.23.0-beta, described by behaviour)

A separate describer compared upstream's beta branch with Vitrine by behaviour only (local notes, not in the
repo). Rounds 3 and 4 closed most of it: Spicy Lyrics' key, credit, pronunciations and back-off; the paused cover;
the clip's pause, Spotify's video, late Canvas, next-track fetch and give-up; the lyrics left alone; tap to seek;
the lock screen's Canvas shape, late Canvas and Canvas service; the lit custom tab; the update check; EeveeSpotify
by class; the app icon error; Signed until; two output chains; and Karaoke's memory, heat, hardware, hysteresis
and download. The rest, on `fix/beta-gaps`:

| Item | Commit |
|---|---|
| The player's clip gives way to Fluid under Reduce Motion and Low Power Mode, and goes at once when the track changes unseen | `992f379` |
| The player's clip is dimmed by its brightness, 4.5:1 (7:1 with Increase Contrast) for white text | `992f379` |
| A failed clip download is tried again once | `e0ee995` |
| Apple Music's catalog: 10 minutes alone after a 403 or 429, searched without the album's edition | `54eb39b` |
| A settings section whose rows all hide takes its heading and note; the ticker follows rows, sliders and menus | `08a9eeb` |
| Below iOS 26 the Lock screen page says Full-screen artwork needs iOS 26 | `be1a478` |
| The Mod Settings row comes back when Spotify empties its settings list or drawer | `8f9f839` |
| The install warning waits for Spotify in front; an unreadable version is not a wrong one | `e26e8a5` |
| Lyrics are looked up for the next track in the background | `28e9e2e` |
| Speed and pitch: no second mixer pull after a failed render, a silent mixer buffer zeroed | `b7bb9d7` |

Still open from the beta gaps: Fluid artwork's settings (SGRFluid.m is being changed elsewhere); the lyrics
opening for Karaoke on a song without lyrics; Karaoke's background download, output latency, interruption and
route handling, seeks and read-ahead limit (the Karaoke rewrite owns them); a change to or from Lyrics on the lock
screen still needs a restart. Deliberate differences: the Off default for the lock screen artwork, the lock
screen page's flag rows, the Reinvented Free player mode turned off, the title kept over the lyrics left alone.
Not gaps: Hide social proof (both flags ship off), recvmsg (Spotify 9.1.78 does not import it).

## Leave out

| # | Item | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | Beta builds update to beta pre-releases | Update check is off until the fork has releases |
| 19, 35, 86 | Certificate offer, Arctic Sign card, usage ping | Third-party signing upsell and upstream telemetry |
| 91, 99, 100, 102, 131 | Plus categories, locks and offer | No paid tier |
| 95 (Account page) | chroma.pw account | No account. The system Settings style is below |
| 129 | "sing limit" | Says nothing buildable |
| 96 | "More visualisations" | One commit in upstream's private repo after 0.23.0-beta. Nothing public says what it adds |
| 107 | The lock screen widget's star switches artwork and lyrics | iOS has no public star command for the lock screen. The Lock screen widget page's choice does the same |

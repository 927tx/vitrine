# Sleep timer harness

`SleepTimer.m` (Shared/Player) as the tweak compiles it, on the Mac, over a player stood in for (`stub/` stands
in for the three UIKit headers it imports, `main.m` answers their calls). It checks the fade's curve (1 until
the last minute, 30 dB down halfway, 60 dB at the end, falling every second), which track ends the album
(tracks queued by hand and autoplay's, by provider or by the is_queued and autoplay.is_autoplay keys, don't
count; repeating, the next track having played already does), and the timer in real time: a 2 s timer starts
faded, pauses at its end and gives the gain back a second later; 15 minutes more and Cancel bring the gain
back at once; End of track pauses half a second before the end, or at once on the next track; End of album
plays past a track with more of the album to come, fades and pauses on the last one, and pauses at once when
autoplay or another album or playlist is playing; a timer up while paused sends no pause. The Fade out choice (`SGInt`,
answered by `main.m`): each length's curve, Off at full volume all the way, none picked and one out of range
read as 30 s; a change applies to a timer already running; at the end of the track or the album the fade
spans a track shorter than it, from its start; a time fades over the last seconds before its end.

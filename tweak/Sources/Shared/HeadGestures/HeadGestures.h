//
//     SGHeadDetector.m         the gestures out of the motion, plain C, tested on the Mac (harness/head-gestures)
//     HeadGestures.x           the motion listened to while the switch is on and Spotify plays, and what each
//                              gesture does through Spotify's player and its collection platform
//     HeadGesturesSettings.m   the page: the switch, each gesture's action, the sensitivity, Try it and Forget
//     HeadGesturesTeach.m      the teaching sheet: five of each gesture, one after each tone, over a ring that

// HeadGestures.x owns the app's one CMHeadphoneMotionManager (iOS hands a manager's motion to one handler) and
// lends its motion to other features through SGHeadMotionListen: Sing's spatial voice listens there.

// Everything applies at once, without a restart.
// Threading: main thread only, but for the listeners' handlers.

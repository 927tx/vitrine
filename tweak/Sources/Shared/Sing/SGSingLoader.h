// Sing's voice model in memory (Sing.h): loaded, warmed, kept a minute after the mic goes off, and dropped.
//
// A copy on the CPU alone comes first, as it loads in seconds: once one prediction of silence has warmed it, the
// separator is Ready and Sing works. Then, while Spotify is in the foreground and the Neural Engine is asked for, a
// copy of the same model on the CPU and Neural Engine loads beside it, warms the same way and is handed to the
// separator, which runs the windows on it from then on, in the background too. Its first load compiles the model for
// the Neural Engine (32-46 s on an iPhone 15 Pro, after every install, as an install moves the app's container; then
// 0.4 s), so it has a deadline of its own; it loads only when the process has the memory left for it.
//
// Core ML cannot cancel a load, and on an iPhone 15 Pro one has never come back. So each load runs on a queue of its
// own, has a deadline, and is abandoned when the deadline passes or the model is dropped: abandoned, it is left to
// finish or hang where it is, and whatever it brings back later is let go. A CPU copy past its deadline makes Sing
// Failed until the mic is switched off and on; a Neural Engine copy past its deadline leaves Sing on the CPU's.
//
// Threading: main thread, but for SGSingLoaderSeparator's separator, which the engine's worker runs.

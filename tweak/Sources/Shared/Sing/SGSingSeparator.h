// Sing's separator: two seconds of a song in, its vocals out, through the voice model (Mel-Band RoFormer
// with KimberleyJensen's vocal checkpoint, MIT; Sing.h says where it comes from). The model is the spectral
// core only, so the STFT around it is done here, as the checkpoint's reference implementation does it
// (its configs/config_vocals_mel_band_roformer.yaml, and model.mil read for the layout):
//
//   44.1 kHz stereo, n_fft 2048, hop 441, a periodic Hann window of 2048, unnormalized, centred with
//   reflect padding (torch.stft's defaults), so two seconds (88200 frames) make 201 frames of 1025 bins.
//   The model's `spectrum` and `vocals_spectrum` are float32 [1, 2050, 201, 2]: axis 1 is bin-major with
//   the two channels interleaved (bin f of channel c at 2f + c, which its band split's gather indices
//   pair up), the last axis real then imaginary (its complex mask multiply reads them so).
//
// The vocals come back from the model's complex mask times the spectrum, through the inverse STFT
// (torch.istft: overlap-add of the windowed frames divided by the window's squared sum).
//
// Two copies of the model can stand behind one separator: the CPU's, which it is made with, and a faster one
// (the GPU's or the Neural Engine's) handed over once it is loaded and warm. A window goes to the faster copy only
// while Spotify is in the foreground (SGSingSeparatorSetForeground), since iOS refuses GPU work from the
// background; a window the faster copy fails is done again on the CPU's, and the faster copy rests until the app
// has left the foreground. The first windows on each copy are logged with their time.
//
// Threading: one separator is used by one thread at a time (its buffers are its own); the faster copy and the
// foreground can be set from any thread.

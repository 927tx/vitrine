// Spotify's own sleep timer, the one set from the player's ⋯ menu (its sheet of times and End of track),
// faded out the way the mod's own is (SleepTimer.h): the same Fade out choice, curve and gain. Spotify's
// player core keeps that timer and pauses at its end; this only reads it off the player's state
// (SPTPlayerState's sleepTimer, Headers/SPTPlayer.h) and never pauses or changes anything of Spotify's.
//
// A check four times a second runs while Spotify plays, or while one of its timers is followed or has just
// gone off; a player state observer starts and stops it. Over the last seconds before the time, or before
// the end of the track, the gain comes down. Once the timer is up (its time came, the track it ended changed,
// Spotify paused or dropped the timer within a couple of seconds of its end) the gain stays down until
// Spotify's pause has landed and comes back a second later, or 5 s on without a pause. A timer cancelled or
// moved later brings the gain back at once. The core may keep a timer that went off in its state for a while,
// so one that went off is not followed again.
//
// It stands aside while the mod's own timer runs, which has the gain then, and while Spotify's own fade is
// forced on (ios-feature-sleeptimer.enable_fade_out, the Labs page's Fade out): with it, Spotify's
// DuckHandlerImpl ducks the core's volume itself (a DuckRequest of a volume and a fade_duration_ms). Off in
// the flag table 9.1.78 ships; a fade that sounds twice as deep means the server turned it on.
//
// Threading: main thread only.

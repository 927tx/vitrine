// The sleep timer, the mod's own, under either look: it pauses Spotify at a time, at the end of the track
// playing, or at the end of the album or playlist playing, and over the last seconds before that (the Fade
// out choice, 30 s unless picked) it fades the sound out through the mod's own gain (SGPlayerSetGain), not
// the system volume. A second after the pause the gain is back to normal, so the next play is at full
// volume. The Live Activity's Timer tab, the Sleep Timer shortcut and its Control Center control set it
// (Shared/LiveActivity), and the card reads it back.
//
// It lasts until it is up or cancelled, or Spotify quits; nothing is stored but the fade's length. While one
// is set a timer checks it four times a second, on the main thread, playing or paused.
//
// Threading: main thread only.

// The player's Visualiser background (PlayerVisualiser.x) reads the sound through this: what Spotify's
// output plays, cut into SGRSpectrumBands bands spaced evenly in pitch from kLowest to kHighest Hz (SGRSpectrum.m),
// each band's level in dB, 0 dB being a full scale sine in it.
//
// Every 1024 samples the last 4096, through a Hann window and Accelerate's real FFT, are summed into the bands
// and published, so at 48 kHz about 47 times a second. Plain C, so harness/visualiser/ runs it on the Mac.
//
// Threading: SGRSpectrumPrepare on the main thread, once, before anything is fed. SGRSpectrumFeed on the render
// thread only, one thread at a time: it allocates nothing and takes no lock. SGRSpectrumRead from any thread.
// What it reads can mix two analyses, a band from each, which nothing drawn can show.

// app (iOS 26.4) sets a playlist or an album: the title, the creator and the length centered, one row of
// shuffle, a white Play capsule and one more round button, and the description under the row.
//
// A page conceals what Spotify draws in its header and puts this in its place, so nothing of Spotify's lays
// it out. It keeps no state of its own: the page hands it the text it read (from Spotify's model or from
// Spotify's concealed labels) and Spotify's own controls to draw from and fire, on every pass, and it lays
// itself out again only when something it shows changed.
//
// Its content sits on its bottom edge with SGRHeaderInfoBottom under it, whatever height the page gives it,
// so the buttons stay just above the first track; what does not fit rises over the picture. The page's
// picture reaches SGRHeaderInfoTitleRise below the content's top, so the title and the creator sit on the
// bottom of its dissolve.
//
// Ownership: the page that adds it; it keeps only weak references to Spotify's controls.
// Threading: main thread only.

// The artwork field: one continuous colour taken from the artwork (SGRPalette.h) behind a whole
// redesigned page, with no card and no seam anywhere. The player's field also carries the
// artwork itself at the top, blurred and dimmed and dissolving into the colour (showsBackdrop).
//
// Nothing is blurred live and nothing is masked: the view draws a solid colour layer, a black gradient
// layer (the redesign is AMOLED throughout, fading the colour to black down the page) and at most one
// bitmap layer rendered off the main thread, so it costs a few composited layers while the page moves. A new colour or bitmap crossfades over
// SGRCrossfade; the same image again is a no-op.
//
// Ownership: the screen that installs a field owns it (usually retained by its superview and an
// associated object). The field retains its last image and palette only.
// Threading: main thread only; the palette work it starts runs off it.
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
